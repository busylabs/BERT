# BERT

This is BERT, a Buildable Educational RoboT.

BERT is very affordable because it is open source and uses off the shelf parts. BERT is WiFi enabled and only needs a browser to control and program. BERT is a fun and enaging tool to learn engineering, coding, and 3-D modeling.

These stl files are specially designed for easy printing with no supports. A nozzle size of 0.4mm or less is recommended due to the print details. For the best Lego compatibility, we recommend printing parts in PETG.

The Thingiverse page for BERT is at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3280675.

We hope you enjoy using BERT.
